# Take-home challenge instructions

### Aim of this challenge:

- Develop a simple web app using [DELETE NON-APPLICABLE] React & TypeScript / React / VanillaJS
- You have full freedom over the styling of your app and while this is not as important to your overall score as functionality and code conventions we would expect your app to be responsive and follow best CSS practices (e.g. BEM naming conventions)
- App.tsx currently imports dummy json data - you **MUST** use data returned from an api call in your final submission, rather than this data.

### Running the app

To fire up the project run `npm install` and then `npm run start` in the root directory
